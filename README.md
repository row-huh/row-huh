### Heyo, I'm Roha

<p>
  I'm a software engineer who writes sometimes, watches too much anime, is into physics, philosophy, and books.  
  I like solving problems, going for long walks, sleeping, talking about tech, and sleeping (yes)
</p>

Lately, i've been
- Diving deep into **LLMs**, **automation agents**, **deep learning**, and **vision**  
- Experimenting with random builds and side projects  
- Occasionally writing blogs and keeping up with AI news (which is pretty much a full-time job at this point)
